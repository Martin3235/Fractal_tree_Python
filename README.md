# Fractal_tree_Python
This Repository contains the Python code to plot fractal trees.

It computes the fractals to different order and subsequently plots them.
In the future I would like to add some real-time plotting where the tree grows.
If have not yet figured out how to get the iterations completely right because e.g. if we have four iterations then there are some branches plotted from the fifth iteration.
